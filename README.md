### Problem

Air Pollution is a huge issue in India, that is why I chose the theme 'Environment' to combat this issue

### Solution

The National Air Monitoring Programme provides real-time access to the Air Quality Index, but currently there is no API that can be utilised to fetch data in the json format. Therefore I use the [WAQI's](https://waqi.info) API to fetch the air quality index. The air quality is assigned three colours:
* Red - For Harmful Air Quality
* Yellow - For Moderate to Unsatisfactory Air Quality
* Green - For Good Air Quality
